### Automatic Ticket Classification using NLP and ML

For a financial company, customer complaints are crucial as they provide insights into the shortcomings of their products and services. Resolving complaints efficiently and on time can reduce customer dissatisfaction and strengthen their loyalty. Additionally, it allows companies to continuously improve their services to attract more customers.

However, evaluating and assigning each customer support ticket to the relevant department can become a tedious task, especially as the company grows and has a large customer base. This is where natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) can come to the rescue.

This project aims to automate the customer support ticket system of a financial company using NLP and ML techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and categorize support tickets based on their content and assign them to the relevant team for swift resolution.

### Solution
To automate the customer support ticket system, we will use NLP techniques to process and analyze the text data. We will apply ML algorithms to classify support tickets based on their content and assign them to the relevant team. The ML component of this project utilizes a powerful algorithm that predicts the ticket's category based on the content of the ticket, achieving high accuracy rates.
